Installing
==========

There are different ways to install Pooch:

.. tabbed:: pip

    Using the `pip <https://pypi.org/project/pip/>`__ package manager:

    .. code:: bash

        python -m pip install pooch

.. tabbed:: conda

    Using the `conda <https://conda.io/>`__ package manager that comes with the
    Anaconda/Miniconda distribution:

    .. code:: bash

        conda install pooch --channel conda-forge

.. tabbed:: Development version

    Using ``pip`` to install the latest **unreleased** version from GitHub
    (**not recommended** in most situations):

    .. code:: bash

        python -m pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/fatiando/pooch

    The commands above should be executed in a terminal. On Windows, use the
    ``cmd.exe`` or the "Anaconda Prompt" app if you're using Anaconda.
